# travel-football-app
This repository contains my final-project which I developed within my final week at SPICED-ACADEMY.
Stack: React | Redux | Express | 3rd Party APIs | Node

It's a single page application which shows live data of the 5 biggest football leagues in Europe, combined with live weather and hotel data from 3rd party APIs (football-data.org, VisualCrossingWeather, booking-com.rapidapi).
The frontend is developed in React.js and the backend in Node.js.

First of all, the user has the possibility to select the desired league and view the current standings or upcoming matches of this league. When clicking on one of the teams, the squad of this team appears. In the next step, the next 10 games of the selected team can be viewed. By clicking on the kick-off time, more detailed information about the upcoming match is provided, including the weather forecast at the venue and hotels near the venue.
